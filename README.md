# Pokemon Type Game

This is a simple Sinatra application that allows the user to play a rock-paper-scissors style game that uses the different types in pokemon to determine a winner. The computer will randomly choose a type and the user will be prompted to choose a type as well. It will then display the result and give the user the option to play again.
